# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem and Eight queen problem with Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction
In this practice Genetic Algorithm used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The cities in Iran are considered as the nodes for the salesman to visit. The `TournamentSelection` method is used for selection and `SwapMutation` is used for mutation in the Genetic Algorithm. Developed Algorithm is used multiple times, with some run considering a penalty based on the distance between cities. The results from different runs are shown on files.

## Data
The data for this project, including the coordinates of the cities and the penalty factors, are stored in Excel files. It is assumed that these files are located in the same directory as the project files.

## Conclusion
Figures on notebooks demonstrates the effectiveness of using Genetic Algorithms for solving optimization problems like the TSP. The use of penalties based on city distances provides an interesting twist to the traditional TSP.

## Usage
To run the program, ensure that the Excel files containing the city coordinates and penalty factors are in the same directory as the jupyter files. Then, simply run the main script.

# Eight queen folder
The Eight Queens puzzle is a classic problem where the goal is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This program uses a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution to this problem.
